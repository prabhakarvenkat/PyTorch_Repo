    <h1>PyTorch Overview</h1>
    <p>PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook. It is primarily used for building and training neural networks. Here is an overview of PyTorch:</p>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Dynamic computation graph</b>: PyTorch's computation graph is dynamic, meaning it can be modified at runtime. This allows for more flexibility and easier debugging.</li>
        <li><b>Automatic differentiation</b>: PyTorch provides automatic differentiation, which simplifies the process of computing gradients and backpropagation.</li>
        <li><b>Pythonic API</b>: PyTorch's API is designed to be easy to use and intuitive, making it accessible to developers of all levels.</li>
        <li><b>Support for GPU acceleration</b>: PyTorch supports GPU acceleration, which can significantly speed up training times.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>PyTorch's architecture is designed to be modular and flexible. It consists of several key components:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Component</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Tensor</b></td>
            <td>A tensor is the basic data structure in PyTorch. It is a multi-dimensional array that can be used to represent data such as images, text, or audio.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Module</b></td>
            <td>A module is a reusable component that performs a specific operation on tensors. Examples of modules include convolutional layers, recurrent layers, and fully connected layers.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Model</b></td>
            <td>A model is a collection of modules that are used together to perform a specific task, such as image classification or language translation.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <p>PyTorch has a wide range of use cases, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Computer vision</b>: PyTorch is widely used for computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation.</li>
        <li><b>Natural language processing</b>: PyTorch is used for natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text classification, and sentiment analysis.</li>
        <li><b>Speech recognition</b>: PyTorch is used for speech recognition tasks such as speech-to-text and voice recognition.</li>
    </ul>
